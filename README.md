Hi there, Iâ€™m Tommy, a first-year Master's student in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST). I am currently working part-time as a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Engineer at Wistron NeWeb Corporation (WNC) and remotely in Cybersecurity at AIXSOAR, where I focus on threat hunting and reducing false alerts using Machine Learning techniques.
