# **Self Introduction**
Hi there, I'm Tommy, a second-year Master's student in Computer Science and Information Engineering at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), specializing in malware static analysis and cross-architecture detection systems under the supervision of Prof. Hahn-Ming Lee and Prof. Shin-Ming Cheng.
My current research focuses on developing cross-architecture malware detection frameworks using Ghidra P-Code intermediate representation, enabling ISA-agnostic analysis across ARM, MIPS, x86, and PowerPC architectures. I'm particularly interested in leveraging graph-based detection models and Transformers for advanced threat analysis.
My technical expertise spans Python, C++, reverse engineering tools (Radare2, Ghidra), machine learning frameworks (PyTorch), and cloud infrastructure deployment. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between academic research and practical cybersecurity solutions.
I look forward to connecting with researchers, industry professionals, and anyone interested in cybersecurity, malware analysis, and AI-driven threat detection.
